# COVID_Cases_By_Age
Code for Shiny app to explore English data on the age distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases: https://victimofmaths.shinyapps.io/COVID_Cases_By_Age/
<br><br>
[global.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID_Cases_By_Age/blob/main/global.R) reads in the latest case data from Public Health England, which is processed by [https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDPHECasesxAgev2.R].<br> 
[ui.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID_Cases_By_Age/blob/main/ui.R) contains the code for the app itself and [server.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID_Cases_By_Age/blob/main/server.R) contains the code to produce the various plots.
